🎤 DAY 1 JAVA INTERVIEW QUESTIONS (WITH ANSWERS)
1️⃣ What is Java?

Answer:
Java is a high-level, object-oriented, platform-independent programming language that uses JVM to run the same program on different operating systems.

2️⃣ Why is Java called platform independent?

Answer:
Java is platform independent because Java code is compiled into bytecode, which can run on any system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

3️⃣ What is the biggest problem Java solved?

Answer:
Java solved the problem of platform dependency, where programs had to be rewritten for different operating systems.

4️⃣ What is bytecode?

Answer:
Bytecode is an intermediate code generated by the Java compiler. It is platform independent and executed by the JVM.

5️⃣ What is JVM?

Answer:
JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an engine that:

Loads bytecode

Verifies it

Converts it into machine code

Executes the program

6️⃣ Difference between JVM, JRE, and JDK?

Answer:

Term	Description
JVM	Executes bytecode
JRE	JVM + libraries (to run Java programs)
JDK	JRE + compiler + tools (to develop programs)
7️⃣ Who developed Java?

Answer:
Java was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems.

8️⃣ Why was Java originally named Oak?

Answer:
Java was initially named Oak after an oak tree outside James Gosling’s office.

9️⃣ Why was the name changed from Oak to Java?

Answer:
The name Oak was already trademarked, so it was changed to Java, inspired by Java coffee.

🔟 What does “Write Once, Run Anywhere” mean?

Answer:
It means that the same Java program can run on any operating system without modification, as long as JVM is present.

1️⃣1️⃣ Is JVM platform independent?

Answer:
❌ No.
JVM is platform dependent, but bytecode is platform independent.

1️⃣2️⃣ Is Java 100% object-oriented?

Answer:
❌ No.
Because Java supports primitive data types like int, float, char.

1️⃣3️⃣ What is the entry point of a Java program?

Answer:
The main() method is the entry point of a Java program.

public static void main(String[] args)

1️⃣4️⃣ Why is the main method static?

Answer:
Because JVM can call the main() method without creating an object of the class.

1️⃣5️⃣ What happens if JVM is not installed?

Answer:
Java programs cannot run without JVM.

1️⃣6️⃣ Can we run Java program without JDK?

Answer:
Yes, we can run Java programs using JRE, but JDK is required to develop Java programs.

1️⃣7️⃣ What are Java editions?

Answer:

Java SE

Java EE

Java ME

1️⃣8️⃣ What is the role of the Java compiler?

Answer:
The Java compiler converts .java source code into .class bytecode.

1️⃣9️⃣ Why is Java considered secure?

Answer:
Java is secure because:

No pointers

Bytecode verification

Security manager

Controlled memory access

2️⃣0️⃣ Where is Java mainly used?

Answer:
Java is used in:

Banking applications

Android development

Web applications

Enterprise systems
