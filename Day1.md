## What is Java?
- Java is highlevel,general purpose,class-based,object-oriented programming language.
- It is platform-independence,portability,robust&security,multi-threading,memory management.
## History of Java
- Founder of java-ScotMcnealy.
- 1991-Java began as the green project at sun microsystems,led by james gosling.
- The goal was to create a language for embedding & electronic devices.
- The first version of language was called Oak.
- 1995-Oak was renamed Java,inspired by coffee.
- Java was official released & became popular because of its platform independence & web support.
- Java gained wide acceptance for web applications & enterprise applications
- 2006-Sun microsystems made open source 
- Later oracle corporation acquired sun microsystems & became the maintainer of java.
- Today,Java is widely used in android apps,web servers,enterprise systems,&cloud computing.
## Why not C/C++?
Because C/C++ are compiled languages.when we write code in C/C++,it directly converted into machinecode by a compiler.This machine code is specific to the os and hardware.Then it make security issues.
- Pros: very fast and efficient
- cons:No portability,manual memory management,&Unsafe operations(pointers,bufferflows)
## Why only Java?
- Java code is first compiled into bytecode,not direct machine code.
- This bytecode runs on the Java virtual machine(JVM),which interprets it for your specific system.
- Because JVM exists on almost every platform,the same Java program can run anywhere without modification.
- pros: platform-independent,safer,automatic memory management.
- cons: slightly slower than direct machine code(through JIT compiler).
## What is JVM?
- The JVM is a Virtual machine that runs java programs.when you write java code:
1. You write .java files (source code).
2.Java compiler(javac) converts it into bytecode (class,files),
